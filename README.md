# minitalk

The purpose of this project is to learn how processes contact each other and how to use signals by making process 1 send
messages to process 2 and print it on the screen.

# Usage

``make`` and then with one terminal write ``./server`` and on a new terminal write ``./client`` and the PID that the server printed.
